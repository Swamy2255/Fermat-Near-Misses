Program Description: This program finds the smallest relative difference between the values of (x^n + y^n) and z^n for given values of n and k. The program iterates through all possible combinations of x and y within the specified range and identifies the z value that closely matches (x^n + y^n). The relative difference is calculated for each set of values, and the combination with the smallest relative miss is identified and displayed.
